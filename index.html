                <h3>opening screen</h3>
                <p>this was a light attempt at an opening screen for login. i would study more logo options but this is a quick one i drafted up to establish a presence on the initial screen. as for the colors, white text on a rich, dark background is necessary. i'm a little concerned about drowning the red out on black. i began testing this more on the last page of this slideshow.</p>

                <h3>home screen (default)</h3>
                <p>this screen should capture the most attention as well as communicate critical information. while i decided to keep the menu at the top left corner and shopping bag at the right, a sub menu can be available immediately underneath. a carousel effect would indicate there are other options to select from. additionally, i've added status icons to notify if the restaurant is open, has been favorited, or has deals available.</p>

                <h3>home screen (browse)</h3>
                <p>a secondary home screen simplifies the information into a browse-able layout. with a shifted emphasis on visuals (due to social media - instagram, pinterest, etc), it would be interesting to convert the traditional menu into one of stimulating photography. to get to this screen, the user swipes the previous screen to the right to hide the text.</p>

                <h3>nav menu</h3>
                <p>the nav menu is great tucked to the side, but with the integration of more detailed options elsewhere, this could be minimized. the item that will probably be most accessed here is 'search'. one tradeoff that i'm considering is merging 'preferences' and 'account', while adding categories of food. this would make sense once the number of restaurants using doordash increases.</p>

                <h3>menu detail</h3>
                <p>once a restaurant has been selected from the home screen, further options could be made available on the bottom of the screen. this defaults to the menu, and offers the ability to locate the restaurant, see their deals, mark it as a favorite, or read the reviews (via yelp, urbanspoon, etc.) another feature i've tried to add to this page is the immediate visual of being able to customize an order, in addition to adding or subtracting it. limiting the description characters is important here - i think hungry people just want to order, not read a novel.</p>

                <h3>selection detail</h3>
                <p>as mentioned previously, this customization pops up as soon as a 'select size' or 'select protein' is clicked. finding this in the item's own screen seems excessive.</p>

                <h3>checkout</h3>
                <p>this should be relatively self-explanatory. any items added could be deleted from here or edited when clicked on. checking off the tip will pop a screen that will ask for a percentage, with default at 15%. not sure if this is typical. another option is to type in the promo code, where a keyboard will appear. confirmation of the address, contact number and last four digits of a credit card would be useful - especially for those who would use doordash in multiple locations.</p>

                <h3>search by proximity</h3>
                <p>i lightly investigated 'search' in multiple forms. however, considering that the map is most commonly used, i did a quick mockup of this, which follows a similar language as the previous screens. something i began thinking about was scalability and how difficult it is sometimes to know how far something really is on a map. it would be useful to know if that restaurant downtown is actually 2 minutes away rather than 20 minutes away. perhaps an adjusting mile notice at the top would suffice.</p>

                <h3>logo & color</h3>
                <p>as mentioned in the first slide, i played around with a logo concept that would need refinement. this was more of a visual test in color than shape, but if it remained a text-based logo, a style guide would have to be established for the application.</p>
